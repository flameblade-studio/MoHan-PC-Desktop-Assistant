All notable public changes to MoHan Desktop Assistant are documented here.

## v2.0.14 RC — 2026-07-31

- Fixed OpenAI streaming WAV headers overflowing during application-local
  volume processing, which could make all cloud speech silent.
- Rebuilt adjusted WAV headers from the audio bytes actually received instead
  of copying streaming placeholder lengths.
- Added automatic Windows Yating fallback when OpenAI speech generation or
  playback fails.
- Routed safe read-only Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive commands from
  the normal text conversation box into the permission-gated tool planner.
- Added regression coverage for cloud-speech fallback, streaming WAV volume
  processing, Gmail chat routing, and work-timer isolation.

Verification: 38/38 automated test programs, real OpenAI TTS playback,
packaged self-test, packaged event-loop smoke test, and post-archive self-test
passed before this release candidate.
